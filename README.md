## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:** This project uses a **single shared password** for all users. It is not secure for production.
If you want to make it more realistic:

* ✅ Implement **per-user authentication** (username + password)
* ✅ Store passwords with **bcrypt hashing**
* ✅ Use **sessions** or **JWT tokens**
* ✅ Serve via **HTTPS**
* ✅ Sanitize inputs (to prevent XSS & SQL injection)

👉 Do you want me to also give you a **small PHP code snippet** that upgrades your **“one password” login** into a **per-user login system with usernames + hashed passwords** (so you can expand your repo securely)?
